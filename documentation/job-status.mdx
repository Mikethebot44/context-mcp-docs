# Monitoring Jobs (`index-job-status`)

`index-job-status` gives you full visibility into every background crawl triggered by `index-content`. Use it to poll progress, fetch ingestion stats, or list recent runs when you forget a job identifier.

## Parameters

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `job_id` | string? | Inspect a single job by ID. |
| `source_url` | string? | Fetch the most recent job for a specific documentation site or repository. |
| `include_payload` | boolean? | When `true`, the response includes ingestion stats such as counts and metadata summaries. |
| `limit` | number? | How many recent jobs to list when no `job_id`/`source_url` is provided (default 10, max 50). |

Use either `job_id`, `source_url`, or neither (to list jobs). Supplying both `job_id` and `source_url` is unnecessary; `job_id` takes precedence.

## Example: Poll by `job_id`

**Prompt**

> “Check index-job-status for job 4f8a2382-9f0b-4e7d-8454-b2c6eaa75a8d and include the ingestion payload.”

**Response**

```json
{
  "id": "4f8a2382-9f0b-4e7d-8454-b2c6eaa75a8d",
  "type": "documentation-index",
  "sourceUrl": "https://docs.example.com",
  "status": "completed",
  "createdAt": "2024-06-02T15:04:18.231Z",
  "startedAt": "2024-06-02T15:04:20.115Z",
  "finishedAt": "2024-06-02T15:05:03.912Z",
  "progress": {
    "stage": "completed",
    "message": "Job completed",
    "percent": 1,
    "timestamp": "2024-06-02T15:05:03.912Z"
  },
  "progressLog": [
    { "stage": "queued", "message": "Job queued", "percent": 0, "timestamp": "..." },
    { "stage": "discovery", "message": "Crawler discovered 134 documentation pages", "percent": 0.25, "timestamp": "..." }
  ],
  "result": {
    "namespace": "Documentation",
    "indexedCount": 128,
    "skippedCount": 6,
    "cachedCount": 94,
    "details": {
      "pagesIndexed": 134,
      "embeddedCount": 128,
      "cachedCount": 94
    }
  }
}
```

## Example: List Recent Jobs

**Prompt**

> “List the five most recent index jobs.”

**Response**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "job_latest",
    "sourceUrl": "https://docs.widgets.io",
    "status": "completed",
    "namespace": "Documentation"
  },
  {
    "id": "job_previous",
    "sourceUrl": "https://github.com/example/awesome-repo",
    "status": "running",
    "namespace": "Github"
  }
]
```

The array is ordered by completion time, making it easy to audit your indexing history.

## Progress Stages

Expect to see stages such as:

- `queued` – The job is waiting for a worker slot.
- `initializing` – Parameters validated; resources allocated.
- `discovery` / `filtering` – Documentation crawler is expanding sitemaps and pruning URLs.
- `scan` / `ast` – Repository walker is fetching blobs and extracting structural metadata.
- `ingest-*` – Entries are being embedded and upserted.
- `completed` or `failed` – Terminal states.

If a job fails, inspect `error` in the response; the message explains whether it was an authentication issue, a missing repository, or an unexpected crawler error.
