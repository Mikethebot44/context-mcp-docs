# Recommended Workflows

The four tools work best when chained together. Use the playbooks below as templates for common tasks.

## 1. Bring a Documentation Site Online

1. **Kick off indexing**
   - **Prompt:** “Index https://docs.widgets.io.”
   - **Response:** `{"tool":"index-content","jobId":"job_docs","status":"queued"}`
2. **Watch the job**
   - **Prompt:** “Run index-job-status for job_docs.”
   - **Response:** `{"tool":"index-job-status","jobId":"job_docs","state":"completed"}`
3. **Search immediately**
   - **Prompt:** “Search-content for ‘What scopes do tokens need?’ with documentation sources.”
   - **Response:** JSON hit list pointing at `https://docs.widgets.io/auth/scopes`.
4. **Inspect the source if needed**
   - **Prompt:** “Scrape-content https://docs.widgets.io/auth/scopes.”
   - **Response:** Markdown content you can paste into a follow-up answer.

## 2. Audit a Repository Before Release

1. **Index the repo**
   - **Prompt:** “Index https://github.com/widgets/monorepo so I can review the latest SDK changes.”
2. **Track ingestion stats**
   - **Prompt:** “Check index-job-status for <repo-job-id> with include_payload true.”
   - **Response:** Includes `indexedCount`, `cachedCount`, and namespace details—confirm they match expectations.
3. **Run semantic smoke tests**
   - **Prompt:** “Search-content for ‘Explain how rate limiting works’ but only in the GitHub namespace.”
4. **Deep dive into a file**
   - **Prompt:** “Scrape-content https://github.com/widgets/monorepo/blob/main/services/rate-limit.ts.”

## 3. Investigate a Support Ticket

1. **Search across everything**
   - **Prompt:** “Search-content for ‘timeouts when uploading large media’.”
2. **No hits? Verify freshness**
   - **Prompt:** “Run index-job-status for source https://docs.widgets.io.”
   - If the latest job is old, trigger `index-content` again and repeat the search.
3. **Share the exact snippet**
   - **Prompt:** “Scrape-content <returned URL> so I can quote the precise remediation steps.”

## 4. Periodic Maintenance Loop

- Schedule `index-content` runs (docs + repos) after each deployment.
- Keep a simple dashboard that calls `index-job-status` with `limit = 20` to monitor historical jobs.
- Spot-check random hits by pairing `search-content` with `scrape-content` so you can confirm snippets stay fresh.

Following these patterns ensures your MCP assistant always has current, trustworthy context without manual copy/paste work.
