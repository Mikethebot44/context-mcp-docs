# Quickstart

Follow these steps to connect any MCP-compatible client to the Context MCP server and run your first workflow. All examples assume the hosted endpoint lives at `https://context-mcp.vercel.app`.

## 1. Obtain access details

Ask your platform admin for:

- Server base URL (`https://context-mcp.vercel.app`).
- API token if your organization issues per-user credentials.
- Approved documentation or repository domains you’re allowed to index.

## 2. Register the server with your client

Add the endpoint to your client configuration. Here is a Cursor-style example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-mcp": {
      "url": "https://context-mcp.vercel.app"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the client so it discovers the new tools. Claude Desktop, Windsurf, and Continue have equivalent “Add MCP Server” dialogs where you paste the same URL.

## 3. Verify connectivity

Open the client’s command palette (for example `Ctrl+Shift+P → MCP: List Tools`) and confirm the following commands appear: `index-content`, `scrape-content`, `index-job-status`, and `search-content`. If your client surfaces sample invocations, run one of the health-check commands to make sure responses stream back immediately.

## 4. Kick off your first index job

**Prompt**

> “Index https://docs.widgets.io so I can search it later.”

**Response**

```json
{
  "tool": "index-content",
  "jobId": "job_Zp62xxM86Q",
  "status": "queued",
  "message": "Documentation indexing runs asynchronously. Use index-job-status job_Zp62xxM86Q to monitor progress."
}
```

## 5. Monitor the crawl

**Prompt**

> “Check index-job-status for job_Zp62xxM86Q.”

**Response**

```json
{
  "tool": "index-job-status",
  "jobId": "job_Zp62xxM86Q",
  "state": "completed",
  "documentsIndexed": 42
}
```

When the job is `completed`, the new resource (for example `doc:https://docs.widgets.io`) becomes searchable immediately.

## 6. Ask questions against the new corpus

**Prompt**

> “Search the Widgets docs for authentication requirements.”

**Response**

```json
{
  "tool": "search-content",
  "query": "authentication requirements",
  "sources": ["documentation"],
  "results": [
    {
      "resourceId": "doc:https://docs.widgets.io",
      "url": "https://docs.widgets.io/api/auth",
      "snippet": "Supply personal access tokens in the Authorization header..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## 7. Pull the exact source text

**Prompt**

> “Use scrape-content to grab https://docs.widgets.io/api/auth so I can quote the exact wording.”

**Response**

```json
{
  "tool": "scrape-content",
  "url": "https://docs.widgets.io/api/auth",
  "content": "## Authentication\nSupply personal access tokens..."
}
```

Re-run `index-content` whenever upstream docs or repos change, and rely on `index-job-status` to keep tabs on background crawls. The MCP transport is stateless, so you can restart your IDE at any time without interrupting work in flight.
